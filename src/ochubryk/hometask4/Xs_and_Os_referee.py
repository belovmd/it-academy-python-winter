# Tic-Tac-Toe, sometimes also known as Xs and Os,
# is a game for two players (X and O) who take turns
# marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds
# in placing three respective marks in a horizontal,
# vertical, or diagonal rows (NW-SE and NE-SW) wins the game.
#
# But we will not be playing this game. You will be the referee
# for this games results. You are given a result of a game and
# you must determine if the game ends in a win or a draw as well
# as who will be the winner. Make sure to return "X" if the
# X-player wins and "O" if the O-player wins.
# If the game is a draw, return "D".
#
# A game's result is presented as a list of strings,
# where "X" and "O" are players' marks and "." is the empty cell.
